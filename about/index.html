<p>If you&rsquo;ve arrived on this page, you may be wondering: Who are you? What is WSL? Why am I reading this?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a hobbyist programmer, and have been messing around with various little programming projects since I was a kid borrowing books on C programming from the local library. I think I originally started programming because as a kid I had no way of actually buying computer games, and figured &ldquo;heck, I could make something myself!&rdquo; Like most kids, my interest and enthusiasm (and patience) fluctuated way too often to ever have any real results, and I eventually stopped making things when I left high school.</p>

<p>About ten years later, I was bored over a winter break in school and stumbled across the <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod">Libtcod Python Roguelike Tutorial</a> and decided that I would pick up this old hobby and learn Python. A few weeks of furious coding after the tutorial I ended up with something I was actually pretty proud of, my first &ldquo;real&rdquo; game! It was pretty okay, and actually pretty fun. Most of all, it was a great learning experience and was extremely motivating to try something else.</p>

<p>I have a weird obsession with making things from scratch - so naturally I decided to attempt to learn C++. This blog was created to document my struggles, successes, and failures attempting to mash C++ together into a cohesive program.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on a roguelike, written in C++. I do all of my code in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> on <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>.</p>

<p>This website was created using <a href="/">Hugo</a>, the <a href="/">XMin</a> theme, and some borrowed ideas from the internet.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-wsl">What is WSL?</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s short for &ldquo;weasel&rdquo; - Most of my ideas began as inspiration gained from watching too many cartoons - this one was from Cow and Chicken. Also, hilariously, it&rsquo;s the abbreviation for the World Surf League - which I am 100% not affiliated with, unless they want to hook me up with a t-shirt featuring a surfing mustelid or something.</p>
