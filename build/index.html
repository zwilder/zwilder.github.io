      <div class="content">
        Man, I really don&rsquo;t do a lot of work on this blog - maybe because I am not a web programmer but I can see when this blog does not look very good.
Well, I officially gave up on web design. Yep! Turns out, I should probably leave that to the professionals. Oh, and I also decided to heck with Jekyll. It was cool, and worked well - but searching for a premade Jekyll theme was a chore.

      <div class="content">
        Over the past couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been working on simplifying the code for my roguelike project - heavily inspired by one of my favorite books on my shelf, Game Programming Patterns.
I&rsquo;ve seriously read this book cover to cover, multiple times - and every time find a new use for one of the &lsquo;patterns&rsquo; in it. I just discovered that the author&rsquo;s blog has a bunch of good reads on it as well.

      <div class="content">
        So, every time I get the urge to write a blog post about whatever random bit of code I&rsquo;m writing - I look at the blog and think: &ldquo;Hm, this is kinda ugly.&rdquo; Then, I have to rewrite it until I&rsquo;m mostly satisfied with how it looks.
Recently, I&rsquo;ve been working on writing a nice little interface for handling menus and other parts of the UI for my roguelike project. Unfortunately, like the layout of this blog, I can&rsquo;t seem to find a satisfactory &lsquo;look and feel&rsquo; - I think I&rsquo;ve got a good start though.

      <div class="content">
        The one bad thing about hosting a static blog is that implementing comments means you:
 Outsource, letting some other site handle it (like Disqus) Come up with some sort of crazy contraption to force a comment system into a static blog Spend hours scouring the internet to see what other people have done.  Obviously, outsourcing wasn&rsquo;t an option - Disqus looks nice and all, and I&rsquo;m sure it would be fine for a lot of people, but it just wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted.

      <div class="content">
        I&rsquo;ve been wanting to fix this blog for a while now, and I decided in the process that I am awful at web design/programming. Haha, well, the first step to being kinda good at something is kinda sucking at something, right?
In my scouring of the internet I discovered that a lot of static blog sites used Jekyll to generate their site. At first, I figured it was nothing more than another insta-blog program where you just dump some content into a folder and it spits out a blog - but holy cow it is so much more than (and can be exactly) that.

      <div class="content">
        Continuing in my never-ending project to make a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; roguelike in C++, I decided to tackle something I have never before tried: artificial intelligence. My first rough idea was to implement some sort of component-type system, and build the AI up like I built up entities. This turned out to be far too complicated, and even getting a monster to move randomly was a chore. Obviously, this wasn&rsquo;t going to work.
