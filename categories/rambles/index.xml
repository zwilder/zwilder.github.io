      <description>Well, my ambition to change the blog to a collection of posts about what I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing apparently didn&amp;rsquo;t pan out for me posting more often. Time to bring the blog back from the dead - some techno-necromancy.
What&amp;rsquo;s happened in the three years and change since the last post? A lot, actually. Ignoring the political landscape and all the nonsense from the COVID times is hard, and probably why I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel motivated to write anything about what I was doing with my personal life.
In 2020, my family and I relocated to small town coastal Oregon from the sprawling metropolis of Phoenix, AZ.</description>
