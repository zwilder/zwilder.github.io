      <description>Since this blog now exists I thought I would share one of my favorite old stories, and possibly one of the stranger encounters I&amp;rsquo;ve had. A good alternative title for this story would be &amp;ldquo;Out of the hole and facing rebirth&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
One of my favorite things about this job is completing service requests - these are generally requests from people who actually want to see us. A nice change of pace from being the bearer of usually unpleasant news. Most of these requests are pretty routine - &amp;ldquo;person concerned about tree in proximity to power lines&amp;rdquo; is by far the most common. On this particular request, a neighbor was concerned about a property behind hers with a large tree growing into high voltage lines. Nothing strange, but not on her property. I called the person who made the request before heading out to see if I could get some more details and get access to her yard to see things from her vantage point.</description>
