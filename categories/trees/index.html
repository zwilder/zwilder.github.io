            Background Sersia lancea, the African sumac, is a common tree around the valley - the strong fragrance of its diminuitive flowers remind me strongly of spring time as a kid growing up in Phoenix. The tree is relatively unassuming, no showy flowers in the spring and no vibrant colours in the fall. Like most invading trees, it was originally brought to the valley in the 60s as a landscape tree. I&rsquo;d venture to guess that most homes built in the 60s and early 70s had an African sumac planted prominently in the front yard or back yard.
As can probably be deducted from the common name, it is one of the most common trees in South Africa. In the native range, livestock that graze too heavily on the leaves will develop a foul taste in their milk. The bark, leaves, and twigs provided indigenous groups with a valuable source of tannin for leather making. The sumac&rsquo;s hard wood was used for making bows and weaponry, and also as fenceposts - and it&rsquo;s easy to see why when looking at the long, slender water sprouts.
  The African sumac is in the Anarcadiacea family, which is the same family as cashews, mangos, pistachios, and poison ivy. I&rsquo;ve read in various online sources hints that the peppercorns of the African sumac have been used as a spice, and even used as one of the main ingredients in a type of honey mead - although despite my best googling I was unable to find more information to back up this claim.
The African sumac&rsquo;s botanical name, Sersia lancea, was formally Rhus lancea. Rhus is the latin word for sumac, and lancea was a type of spear used by Roman infantry - a reference to the shape of the leaflets. The tree was formally renamed to Sersia in the early 90s in honor of the botanist and author Paul B. Sears.
The tree is very easily propogated by the peppercorn-like seeds, which is a problem because birds love these seeds. So, naturally, in any area in Phoenix where there is water, you&rsquo;ll see these trees sprout up.

            Background Ailanthus, tree of heaven, paradise tree, or tree of hell (as many like to call it) is an invasive tree across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. First introduced as an ornamental in the Eastern US and brought to California during the gold rush. This tree is common in urban areas and very tolerant of pollution and poor soil conditions. You can see tree of heaven in many mining towns in Arizona, some say it is holding up the old copper mining town of Jerome.
  In Phoenix I&rsquo;ve come across ailanthus in older neighborhoods and I can see its invasive nature by the numerous amount of small trees and sprouts surrounding the larger trees. Tree of heaven is dioecious (trees are either male or female), the male flowers have a very offensive odor. Crushed leaflets smell like peanuts to some.
  The numerous seeds produced by ailanthus are only viable for 1 year and they spread by wind, water, birds, and humans. Established trees have long shallow lateral roots that sprout prolifically, often more so when the tree is disturbed. The sprouts grow very fast and have been recorded to grow 1&rdquo; per day (Harlow, et al). Control is very difficult and usually a combination of cut stump treatment and foliar sprays are needed.
Identification Tree of heaven has large alternate compound leaves (1&rsquo; to 3&rsquo; long) with 11 to 41 alternating leaflets. Leaflets are lanceolate with a pointed tip and they have 1 to 5 teeth at the base, but the sides and tip of the leaflet margin are smooth. The fruit is a twisted samara 1 to 1 ½&rdquo; long, with the seed in the center. The twigs are thick and younger stems have many lenticels (raised spots on stem or twig that act as a spore) on the reddish-brown stem. These thick twigs are usually how I spot a tree of heaven, and I look for the large shield-shaped leaf scar. The bark varies and can be smooth to riged, sometimes appearing gray with lighter colored stripes.

            Background Lead tree, river tamarind, faux mimosa - Travel through just about any alleyway in the Phoenix metro area and you are sure to come across this tree. It will usually be loaded with reddish, thin seedpods and likely have many small lead trees around it. Native to southern Mexico, it was originally planted as an ornamental here during the 1970s and 1980s. Supposedly, the tree was promoted as a &ldquo;miracle tree&rdquo; with many uses for the pods and wood. The bark (like many trees) was used in folk medicine to help relieve pain. Some Asian countries (particularly Laos and Indonesia) imported it and incorporated its prolific seed pods into various food dishes. The pods have also been used as a high protein animal fodder - until it became known that it causes hair loss in donkeys and horses.
  The trees grow unbelievably fast and spread quickly - trees less than a year old can produce copious amounts of viable seedpods that will grow wherever they touch soil. An advantage to wandering alleyways is that we are given the opportunity to really watch plants grow. I took the following picture of a small bit of lead tree brush growing in a dirt alleyway around 20th St and Camelback during a routine patrol, and marked it for removal.
  Well, as it was a small bit of brush it was given low priority and not removed by tree crews when they came through the area. A few months later in response to a homeowner request, I found myself staring at a tree that looked familiar&hellip; This was growth during a very hot and dry summer - March 26, 2017 to September 22, 2017.
  Look at that growth in six months! From barely taller than the cinderblock wall to reaching up and above the communication wires into the secondary power lines! The increase in diameter is significant as well - that&rsquo;s easily an inch and a half of growth. And the canopy! Those two small little twigs flanking the main stem in the first picture became enormous!
