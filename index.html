question and a prompt.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;new player&rdquo; screen was originally made as a &ldquo;quick and dirty&rdquo; sort of
thing, with the intention of replacing it with something fancier - or at least
more flashy. It&rsquo;s really grown on me since I originally wrote it, and I don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;m going to change it. What does still bother me though, is that if you
just hit enter without putting down something a little message box pops up,
asking you to &ldquo;Please try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s kinda lame, and directly above the code that does that error checking
(was) a comment I wrote to myself: &ldquo;It would be super cool if this was replaced
with a call to a random name generator&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well I came across that comment while rewriting all the drawing and input
handling code, and decided <strong>that</strong> was going to be my next project.</p>
<p>Random words are typically not just random characters slapped together - that
would just give words like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>alxvik hhbatxr orikumo kxzzmk cafzrx jkiuvfm</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not very satisfying, right? Are those names? Places? Plants? Weapons? Who knows.
To get more satisfying words, a better approach is to use a Markov Chain - what
Wikipedia defines cryptically as &ldquo;a stochastic model describing a sequence of
possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state
attained in the previous event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a bunch of fancy words to say (in this context) that if you start
with a sequence of letters, which next letter is most likely to occur?</p>
<p>If you know those probabilities, word generation becomes easy - start with a few
letters, figure out what letter could come next, choose one of those letters and
start the process over with that letter and the preceding letters. With any
dataset input, the words that would be generated following these probabilities
would (should) be very similar to the input. I could even take multiple
datasets, generate some words, handpick words I like for another dataset, and
then generate a whole bunch of words similar to the ones I like!</p>
<p>To start this project, I needed data structures for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of strings, to hold the words read in from the dataset.</li>
<li>A list of characters, to hold the characters that follow each &ldquo;key&rdquo; in the
hash table.</li>
<li>A hash table, with each key/value pair being a string/list of characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>These data structures were a lot of fun to implement, and good practice to put
together. I might write another post on what those look like and the thoughts
that went into those.</p>
<p>I also needed &ldquo;training&rdquo; datasets to generate the hash table (lists of words)
and a routine to read those words in. I started this project with a list of
names that I pulled from the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">Social Security Administration&rsquo;s
website</a> - amazingly you can
download a set of CSV files that contain names, assigned sex, and number of
children registered with that name each year since 1880. Which is
all sorts of fun - there were 10,069 Marjories registered with the SSA in 1924,
for example.</p>
<p>The hash table is the real workhorse - it provides the tables we roll on to
determine which characters come next. To build the table, the program does the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open&rsquo;s the dataset file</li>
<li>Read and store words in a list of strings</li>
<li>Loop through the list and:
<ul>
<li>Take the first N characters of a word (eg: for the word &ldquo;Richard&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ri&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Look through the list of words for any two characters that match the key. Any
matches and the following character is added to a list (&lsquo;c&rsquo; comes after &ldquo;Ri&rdquo;
in &ldquo;Richard&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add to the hash table the key, and the list of characters</li>
<li>Repeat with the next N characters in the word (&ldquo;ic&rdquo; from our example)</li>
<li>Continue until you reach the end of the word, and then move to the next word</li>
</ol>
<p>Easy enough, right? Well it turns out there is still a couple little things to
smooth out. Lets look at an example dataset, with the following names (the top
ten male names of 1937):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robert James John William Richard Charles Donald David Thomas George</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hash table generated (with a key size of 2) would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>********************

Key: al | Values: ['d']
Key: am | Values: ['e','','','e']
Key: ar | Values: ['d','l','l','d']

</code></pre><p>Very cool. The important thing to note is the duplicate letters and the &ldquo;empty&rdquo;
lists. The empty lists actually contain the character &lsquo;\0&rsquo; (NULL) - indicating
the end of a word. If you look closely you&rsquo;ll see that every two letter
sequence at the end of the word has the NULL character as an option in it&rsquo;s list
of characters. The duplicates are what gives our probabilities - in this example
&lsquo;<code>ar</code>&rsquo; has a 2/4 chance of being followed by a &lsquo;<code>d</code>&rsquo;, and a 2/4 chance of being
followed by an &lsquo;<code>l</code>&rsquo;. The keen observer will also notice that those come from the
words &ldquo;<code>Charles</code>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<code>Richard</code>&rdquo;, and that the process to generate the table reads
each word twice. The duplicates aren&rsquo;t a problem in practice, since if each word
was only read once the probabilities would still be 1/2 and 1/2 - 50%.
Similarly, &lsquo;<code>am</code>&rsquo; has an equal chance of being followed by an &lsquo;<code>e</code>&rsquo; or NULL, ending the
word.</p>
<p>If we use this table by grabbing a random node and preceding outwards from there
until some max length we end up with words like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Nald Rgeorge Avid Nald John Id Es Icharle Onald Ard Nald Bert Onald Harles Mas Rles Hn Lliames Es Icharle</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Better than just choosing random characters - these at least look almost
recognizable as names! However, it&rsquo;s odd starting a name with some of those
keys - and importantly some of those keys have no chance of generating a
following character. To fix this, the hash table keeps a list of &ldquo;starter&rdquo; keys,
keys that are at the beginning of each word in the dataset. In our example
dataset:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>ro ja jo wi ri ch do da th ge</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting a word with those and moving outwards changes our results to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Georgeo Chard Richard Donald David Thomas Robert Richarl Robert Georgeo David John John Charles William David James Charles Donald Charles</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well hot dang, we are in business! Those are clearly recognizable names, but
definitely not very random. In fact, only a couple of those aren&rsquo;t in our
original dataset! We need a bigger dataset to see different names, so lets feed
the machine a list of a 100 names:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Dank Me Leormas Joe Bruce Hard Billiamue Eddie Walvin Lloyd Josephill Ardonard Frandrenn Frene Bobby Cary Vey Haelvin Las</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, better. However, using the larger dataset we definitely lost some of
the &ldquo;flavor&rdquo; of the input. The names don&rsquo;t look very recognizable anymore - like
maybe names in another language. Adjusting the key size from 2 to 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Samuel Kennis John Cliffordo Marvey Johnny Bruce Jim Clarence Andrew Herbert Edwin Johnny Jack Henry Jimmie Raymond Hen Roy Raymond Bernard Donard Martin Clarry Patrick Ray Paul Lawrence Gord Eugene George Vernest</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There it is. Those are clearly names, and it preserves the taste of the original
dataset. I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see any of those names in
the dataset. Now comes the fun part - what if we put in a list of something
else?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zwilder/markov/blob/master/data/minerals.txt">Minerals</a>? That output looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Antimotoite Austibite Algodonite Allacrandite Akagai Aeschite Alite Abertonite Ardite Anorthinite Bayldonite Alactite Abergentigorite Benioside Billite Barsenic Borax Apatite Apatite Arstowite Ldersonite Aeschite Arcticite Axinite Baotite Azurite Antlerite Aerite Annite Acantlerite Barsenopyrite Anorthony</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zwilder/markov/blob/master/data/flowers_scientific.txt">Scientific names of flowers gives</a> us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Syrine Lathyrus Alstrelizia Digitalis Spectabiosa Muscabiosa Neria Rosa Alchemilladio Syringa Lavandula Tanacea Belladonna Tanacetum Neria Chamaryllia Aquilegia Parthemum Aster Delphinops Dianthurium Gladonna Chrysantirrha</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent - this is what I wanted. Without checking, I would believe that any of
those are actually flowers or minerals. Now lets fancy it up a bit - lets feed
the generator a list of <a href="https://github.com/zwilder/markov/blob/master/data/tolkein.txt">Tolkien
names</a>, and a
list of <a href="https://github.com/zwilder/markov/blob/master/data/dutch.txt">Dutch
words</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Neek Sloth Margrimbul Eradalmarie Marel Nijmegen Leod Hingeloopen Bardenbrambaran Veereneke Everdamiril Adrahamuet Joch Joostoffelandri Hulst Eleb Fran Eren Eothoron Maratan Alone Ommen Theda Belenducalmeleb Hanniel Mauhur Nime</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would absolutely believe those are the names of some Elves or something. I
could mix up and match datasets, fiddling with results all day. Probably one of
the cooler bits of code I&rsquo;ve ever written. The project is up on
<a href="https://github.com/zwilder/markov">Github</a>. It still needs some tweaks - if
it&rsquo;s fed a dataset with extended characters (&ldquo;wide&rdquo; characters, or <code>wchar</code>
characters in C parlance) the whole thing breaks. I could fix this pretty
easily, but not quickly - I would have to rewrite the list of strings structure
and dataset loading functions at a minimum. It will also crash if the
dataset is too large, or if the key size causes too many keys to be generated.
All minor things really, and stuff that could easily be worked around. I haven&rsquo;t
plugged all this into the Goblin Caves project - yet. Still trying to figure out
the best way to do that.  The generator works quick enough that I could have it
generate new words &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; - but really it might be better to have it spit
out a thousand words and then just have the game choose from those at random,
loaded in from a config file. For the new player screen, I could give the player
a list of ten random names, and they could choose from those to fill in the
entry field to edit or accept as is.</p>
<p>I suppose all of those things are next on the agenda - I made a cool thing,
now I need to stick it in with all the other cool things and use the hell out of
it. &ldquo;Unique&rdquo; goblins with names: Cirdan the Butcher, Radalf the Sly, Chief
Ratitis&hellip; Weapons: The battle axe &ldquo;Tulkasr&rdquo;, &ldquo;Anfaug&rdquo; the cleaver&hellip; All sorts
of possibilities to add some variety and color to the caves.</p>
