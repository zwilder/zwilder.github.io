      <title>The Roguelike Tutorial - Week 2</title>

      <description>So this week&amp;rsquo;s goal is to finish part 2 and part 3 of the tutorial - I worked ahead because I was excited to get this project going, which worked out well since shortly after finishing part 2 I switched to SDL from SFML and it gave me some time to work on this blog.
The Switch to SDL So the game logic is completely divorced from the rendering system - I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be tied into using a set framework if I want to change later, and I know for a fact from previous projects this will make save files much easier to generate.</description>

      <title>The Roguelike Tutorial - Week 1</title>

      <description>Last year r/roguelikedev did a really cool thing with a weekly post where everyone followed along with a tutorial, shared ideas and problems, and motivated each other to actually finish a project. Well they&amp;rsquo;re doing it again this year, and with the announcement last week I decided to take a look at the new and improved, Python3 version of the tutorial.
For those not familiar with this famous tutorial - each part covers a small chunk of building a roguelike using simple language and easy to follow code.</description>

      <title>Messing With Web Design - Again</title>

      <description>Ok, so it turns out I still can&amp;rsquo;t stand using a premade theme. I decided to look again at Hugo themes, and found XMin. Clean, simple, and a good basic idea of what I wanted this blog to look like. Cracked open the source code and was playing around&amp;hellip; one thing led to another and this is what I ended up with.
Really enjoying working with Hugo - haven&amp;rsquo;t even played with any of the cool powerful features that it has, but I am very impressed with how easy it is to modify and change things.</description>

      <title>Yet Another Blog Attempt</title>

      <description>Man, I really don&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of work on this blog - maybe because I am not a web programmer but I can see when this blog does not look very good.
Well, I officially gave up on web design. Yep! Turns out, I should probably leave that to the professionals. Oh, and I also decided to heck with Jekyll. It was cool, and worked well - but searching for a premade Jekyll theme was a chore.</description>

      <description>Over the past couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on simplifying the code for my roguelike project - heavily inspired by one of my favorite books on my shelf, Game Programming Patterns.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seriously read this book cover to cover, multiple times - and every time find a new use for one of the &amp;lsquo;patterns&amp;rsquo; in it. I just discovered that the author&amp;rsquo;s blog has a bunch of good reads on it as well.</description>

      <title>Randomly Generated Caves with Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>So, every time I get the urge to write a blog post about whatever random bit of code I&amp;rsquo;m writing - I look at the blog and think: &amp;ldquo;Hm, this is kinda ugly.&amp;rdquo; Then, I have to rewrite it until I&amp;rsquo;m mostly satisfied with how it looks.
Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on writing a nice little interface for handling menus and other parts of the UI for my roguelike project. Unfortunately, like the layout of this blog, I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find a satisfactory &amp;lsquo;look and feel&amp;rsquo; - I think I&amp;rsquo;ve got a good start though.</description>

      <title>Commenting System with Staticman!</title>

      <description>The one bad thing about hosting a static blog is that implementing comments means you:
 Outsource, letting some other site handle it (like Disqus) Come up with some sort of crazy contraption to force a comment system into a static blog Spend hours scouring the internet to see what other people have done.  Obviously, outsourcing wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option - Disqus looks nice and all, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure it would be fine for a lot of people, but it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I wanted.</description>

      <title>Partying With Jekyll</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to fix this blog for a while now, and I decided in the process that I am awful at web design/programming. Haha, well, the first step to being kinda good at something is kinda sucking at something, right?
In my scouring of the internet I discovered that a lot of static blog sites used Jekyll to generate their site. At first, I figured it was nothing more than another insta-blog program where you just dump some content into a folder and it spits out a blog - but holy cow it is so much more than (and can be exactly) that.</description>

      <title>Fun With Dijkstra Mapping</title>

      <description>Continuing in my never-ending project to make a &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; roguelike in C++, I decided to tackle something I have never before tried: artificial intelligence. My first rough idea was to implement some sort of component-type system, and build the AI up like I built up entities. This turned out to be far too complicated, and even getting a monster to move randomly was a chore. Obviously, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve arrived on this page, you may be wondering: Who are you? What is WSL? Why am I reading this?
I&amp;rsquo;m a hobbyist programmer, and have been messing around with various little programming projects since I was a kid borrowing books on C programming from the local library. I think I originally started programming because as a kid I had no way of actually buying computer games, and figured &amp;ldquo;heck, I could make something myself!</description>
