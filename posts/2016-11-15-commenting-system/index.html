<main>
<p>The one bad thing about hosting a static blog is that implementing comments means you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outsource, letting some other site handle it (like Disqus)</li>
<li>Come up with some sort of crazy contraption to force a comment system into a static blog</li>
<li>Spend hours scouring the internet to see what other people have done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, outsourcing wasn&rsquo;t an option - Disqus looks nice and all, and I&rsquo;m sure it would be fine for a lot of people, but it just wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted. I like having full control of my data. My next idea was to find a free
hosting site and write some crazy PHP and set up a SQL database to set up comments.</p>
<p>But this got me thinking - how did sites handle comments before all this dynamic content was commonplace? A careful google search led me to an amazing blog post by <a href="https://eduardoboucas.com/blog/2016/08/10/staticman.html">Eduardo Boucas</a> on how he solved this exact problem. And holy crap does his solution work exactly like I wanted. In a quick nutshell: <a href="https://staticman.net">Staticman</a> is a Github bot that pushes formatted yml (or json) files into a specified directory that can than be read as comments on the page when the site is built!</p>
<p>So how did I set this up in Jekyll? Read on!</p>
<p>Obviously, the first thing I did was read the documentation on the <a href="https://staticman.net/docs/">Staticman</a> site, and followed the steps listed there. This is what was added to my <code>_config.yml</code> file for the site.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="color:#66d9ef">staticman</span>:
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">allowedFields</span>: [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;name&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;message&#39;</span>]
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">branch</span>: master
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">filename</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;entry{@timestamp}&#39;</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">format</span>: yml
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">generatedFields</span>:
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">date</span>:
      <span style="color:#66d9ef">type</span>: date
      <span style="color:#66d9ef">options</span>:
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">format</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;timestamp-seconds&#34;</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">moderation</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">false</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">path</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;_data/comments/{options.slug}&#34;</span>
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">requiredFields</span>: [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;name&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;message&#39;</span>]
  <span style="color:#66d9ef">url</span>: https://api.staticman.net/v1/entry/zwilder/Hack_Blog/master</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, since the blog is accessible from GitHub, and the repository is public - I removed the email field. I don&rsquo;t think anyone would appreciate their email being so easily accessible (something something security).
The important part of this is the path variable -  this saves comments in their own folder, named after the post they were generated from.</p>
<p>I added the comments into their very own partial HTML page in the <code>_includes\</code> directory.</p>
<p>At the top of the <code>comments.html</code> page:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The forms were also not very complex - basic HTML forms, but the important bit is the <code>name=&quot;fields[]&quot;</code> part. In the <code>_config.yml</code> file, notice that the fields declared are the same here.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, for the fun part: Reading the comments into the file.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Broken down, the code basically checks to see if there is a folder in the comments directory (the path specified in <code>_config.yml</code>) - if there is, the comments are sorted and then looped through.
For each comment, a variable is assigned for the name, date and message, and then with some fancy styling and HTML it is put into the post! Thats it!</p>
<p>I honestly didn&rsquo;t believe it would be that easy - most of what took me time was formatting the forms and laying out the comments section in a pleasing (and hopefully easy to read!) manner. I took some inspiration from my terminal window as I was working - I think it actually looks pretty cool for comments. <a href="https://staticman.net">Staticman</a> is the coolest thing, and I&rsquo;m gonna have to go check out the source and maybe play around with it.</p>
<p>Now, for some fun obstacles - typing liquid code into a markdown page for Jekyll to process as highlighted code&hellip; yeah that doesn&rsquo;t work. Fortunately, you can still use HTML, but then the post becomes a bit
less human readable in it&rsquo;s raw form. To get the HTML code to highlight I let Jekyll build the site with the liquid code processed, opened up the generated HTML file, copy-pasta&rsquo;d it back into the markdown file, and changed the liquid code back to what it should be before Jekyll processed it. Kinda a pain, but definitely easier than doing all the highlighting by hand!</p>
