<main>
<p>I originally planned for this week&rsquo;s blog post to cover my adaptation of
part 5 of the Python RL tutorial - but after finishing part 5 in a
matter of minutes I realized there wouldn&rsquo;t be much to write here! Part
5 is basically making new entities and getting the collision logic in
place before combat is added in part 6. However, before adding combat I
thought it would be beneficial to start thinking about game time - it&rsquo;s
far more fun when some enemies are a lot quicker than the player,
forcing the player to devise strategies for survival.</p>
<p>Naturally, there&rsquo;s a few
<a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Articles#Time_management">articles</a>
on roguebasin -
<a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=An_elegant_time-management_system_for_roguelikes">one</a>
of which I&rsquo;ve read <strong>many</strong> times over the years, and never understood a
word of it. Pascal is a goofy, blunt looking language and really makes
you appreciate how nice programming languages read these days. Or, maybe
I&rsquo;m just dense and don&rsquo;t get it. I love that article though - not only
because it references my favorite roguelike
<a href="https://www.adom.de/home/index.html">ADOM</a>(which, despite playing for
over a decade have never beat), but because of the word &ldquo;elegant.&rdquo; It
just sounds so, appealing.</p>
<p>I sat down, notebook ready, to try and break this article in pieces and
figure out what it&rsquo;s saying. The very first thing it says is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Readers should be familiar with a linked list (next) and
doubly-linked list (prev and next). A circular list simply means that
the last object&rsquo;s &ldquo;next&rdquo; points to the first object; and in a
doubly-linked circular list the first object&rsquo;s &ldquo;prev&rdquo; points to the
last object. The advantage of a circular list over a regular list is
that a circular list need not cater for null-references during
insertion or deletion of objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, my severe lack of formal computer science education meant that I
had no idea what any of those things are, really, beyond the fact that
they exist and there is likely an STL implementation of those I could
find. Searching google for &ldquo;linked list C++&rdquo; led me to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/">this fantastic
site</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to take a step back from this project at this point and learn
all about lists.</p>
<h2 id="super-cool-lists-a-list-is-apparently-nothing-more-than-a-bunch-of">Super Cool Lists A list is apparently nothing more than a bunch of</h2>
<p>linked nodes, with each node containing a piece of data and a pointer to
the next element in the list. Simple enough, right? Well after reading
and writing a few simple little examples toying with creating lists, I
had the realization that this was exactly what I was missing in my
understanding of pathfinding algorithms and could easily be used for a
sort of scheduling system. If a list contained nodes whose data was just
a pointer to an entity, when that node is &ldquo;popped&rdquo; off the top of the
list it could be called for updating in the engine. This means that if a
list was kept as a &ldquo;schedule&rdquo;, the entities who can act could be added
to the schedule and popped off in sequence for updating. Cool right?</p>
<p>So the update routine is now split into two parts: First if the schedule
is not empty, it goes through and updates each actor in the schedule by
popping them off the top. Ideally, I would be doing this in a
<code>while(!schedule_-&gt;isEmpty())</code> loop, and will probably do that once I
finish the actor update routines. A more graceful way of handling entity
updates would be to just return if the entity hasn&rsquo;t decided on an
action, and set the entity actions in their AI update (for the enemies)
or in the keyboard input handling (for the player). For now, since we
have to let the player have a chance to use their turn, the conditional
just returns after removing one actor from the schedule which allows the
engine to continue monitoring input.</p>

        <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span>;
    }
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, when the schedule is empty the game advances a &ldquo;tick&rdquo; and grants
each actor a set amount of energy. Currently, the actors have a base
speed that is added to their energy pool every tick. When their energy
level is greater than the cost of an action (a constant, currently set
to 100), they get added to the schedule.</p>

        gameState_ <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> GameState<span style="color:#f92672">::</span>PLAYERS_TURN;
    }
} 
</code></pre></div>
<p>Simple, right? What makes this neat is</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>ACTION_COST</code> is set to 100</li>
<li>Players speed is 50</li>
<li>Slug speed is 25</li>
<li>Bat speed is 100</li>
</ul>
<p>Then for every 4 turns the player takes, the bat gets 8 and the slug
gets 1. Now if the Bat is able to intelligently use hit and run
tactics&hellip;</p>
<p>The other cool thing about lists is that making a simple priority queue
is an easy leap from a linked list - just attach a priority to each node
and arrange them when the nodes are inserted! This made pathfinding
much, much easier, and I can finally understand and interpret the <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html">Red
Blob Pathfinding
Guide</a>!
Right now I have a basic greedy best first search up and running, and
it&rsquo;s <strong>quick</strong>. Now, it&rsquo;s not very optimal for long paths, but the way I
figure it is the undead denizens of the ruins our burly hero is delving
will only start tracking the player once they see/sense the player -
which means they won&rsquo;t start hunting all the way across the map right
off. I&rsquo;m still tinkering with trying to get A-Star pathfinding working,
but I&rsquo;m anxious to get the enemy actors to actually start doing
something! Plus, I&rsquo;m a tad bit behind the current challenge schedule.
I&rsquo;m going to add this to my list of things to continue working on after
the challenge is over.</p>
<hr>
<p>Up next in part 6 is combat, which should be a lot more fun now that
enemies can take turns at different rates and can intelligently move
towards the player.  Hopefully, if all goes well, I&rsquo;ll be able to show
off a nice video with the next update that will also feature a scrolling
message log and an inventory screen (part 7)! In the meantime, the
<a href="https://github.com/zwilder/barbarian">repository</a> is here - CLOC
reports 2561 lines of code written, and hopefully it&rsquo;s legible and easy
enough to follow.</p>
<p>Here is the source code for <a href="https://github.com/zwilder/Barbarian/tree/Part_5">Part
5</a>!</p>
