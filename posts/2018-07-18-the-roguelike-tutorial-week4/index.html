<main>
<p>The past week has been equal parts frustration and excitement with this project.
I ran into a pretty common design problem: entity components need to know about
the rest of the game. Well, since each entity is just a collection of components
it shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to pass a pointer to the game engine. Then, the
components would have a pointer to the entity that &ldquo;owns&rdquo; it. Simple and
clean&hellip; or so I thought. This didn&rsquo;t work, at all. Individual entities could
access the engine just fine, but the components just could not access anything
about their owner. Even trying to print the address of the owner caused the game
to segfault and crash. GDB was no help, and I tried MANY things to get this to
work.</p>
<p>I realized that I was bashing my head against this problem, and totally stumped,
so I decided to work on something else. I changed  the Engine&rsquo;s entity list from
a <code>std::vector&lt;Entity&gt;</code> to a <code>wsl::DLList&lt;Entity&gt;</code> (from the fancy list class I
created last week). To my surprise and delight, it worked perfectly! What&rsquo;s nice
about using the list I created is that it manages it&rsquo;s own memory - I don&rsquo;t have
to worry about allocations/deallocations no matter how big the list gets!</p>
<p>This got me thinking about best practices and clean code again. In general, I&rsquo;ve
heard you should <strong>always</strong> use the Standard Template Library containers over a
custom rolled solution. However, I know my code, I know how it works, and I can
fix/change it with minimal fuss. Creating a custom wrapper for
<code>std::priority_queue</code> or <code>std::map</code>? No way, I have no idea where to even begin!</p>
<p>So, with this in mind I returned to my original problem. To hell with best
practice, I&rsquo;m not a professional and I don&rsquo;t work with other programmers. My
code is written clearly and commented well, so it should be easy to figure out
why I did things the way I did. I decided that a good, bare bones, no frills
system has components that are nothing more than data containers, and entities
that are collections of components. All the logic is then moved to the entity
class, all the accessors are in the entity class, and the entity itself is
responsible for maintaining it’s components. Yeah, this does mean that a good
large chunk of the game is going to be in the entity class, and that the class
may get a bit bloated - but who cares? It works, and my original problem went
away completely. It will make serialization easier too, because I only need to
serialize Entity - Entity can destruct/construct all of it’s components from raw
data.</p>
<h2 id="part-6">Part 6</h2>
<p>With all that nonsense out of the way, I set about implementing combat. The
first step was collecting all the data parts of the Entity class that dealt only
with actors and moved it to the new Actor component, and adding in the health
points, defense, and power data. Eventually, I’ll want to implement a better
combat system (I like the idea of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/46i4i7/comment/d05al46">percentile based
system</a>),
but for now I’ll stick with following the ideas in the tutorial. Combat was
actually really surprisingly easy to add at this point!</p>
<p>The minor tweaks needed were actually minor, which is nice for a change -
<code>GameMap::isBlocked()</code> for instance only returned true if the tile at the spot
blocked movement, it now also checks the entity list for an entity at that spot
that blocks movement. What’s nice is this inadvertently fixed a glitch with the
pathfinding, monsters now see other monsters as obstacles in the way of their
target. <code>Engine::update()</code> also checks if an entity is dead, to remove it from
the entity list and change the tile it occupied to a corpse. Adding a GameState
for player death was also easy, so the game actually “ends” now. I still need to
make the <code>Engine::newGame()</code> function, but that shouldn’t be difficult. All the
work put into this so far paid off, watching monsters discover, path to, and
attack the player is very exciting - I can`t wait to continue tweaking combat
and actually use the time management I wrote last week!</p>
<h2 id="part-7">Part 7</h2>
<p>So I have an idea of how I want this game to look - eventually. However, I
decided to just drop a basic UI in the game for Part 7. The first task here was
to add a <code>Console::print()</code> function - ha, the last time I opened the console
code was <strong>way</strong> back when the project was first started! Fortunately it’s all
pretty simple and I tried my best to write it with modularity in mind so I can
use it on later projects. A print function has one task, display a string at a
coordinate position. Easy enough - but what if the string is longer than the
console width? Well, thats another easy fix, just advance the y part of the
coordinate pair and continue writing! Simple!</p>

}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Beautiful! Simple! It works! But wait, do you see the problem? Yeah, this splits
a string into characters instead of words! Dang it. Ah well, it’s now my next
thing to fix.</p>
<p>The message log is yet another good fit for the list class I wrote last week.
Engine now has a list it maintains of messages. When something needs to add a
message, the engine examines the top message on the list (head), and combines it
with the new message if the combined length is under a maximum size (the size of
the area on top of the screen for log messages). If the combined string is over
the maximum length, the message will be truncated and pushed to the list with a
new message created for the remainder. A new game state will be added shortly,
<code>GameState::MSG_WAIT</code> which will pause the game (“Press any key to continue”)
when there is more than one message in the message list. I want to limit the
amount of message noise the player sees, so hopefully this shouldn’t occur too
often. I also want to add a 6x12 font file for the UI, since square fonts are
sorta ugly to read. More stuff for the To-Do list!</p>
<p>Here’s a video with this week’s progress and how the game looks at the end of
Part 7:</p>
<div id="ltbox-div">

<p>Super cool, and I’m pretty stoked at this point. Next on the agenda (besides
some minor fixes listed above) is tackling items and healing potions!</p>
