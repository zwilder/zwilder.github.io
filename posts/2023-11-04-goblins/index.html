<main>
<p>As a kid, I wanted to learn how to program to make computer games. That was the
original goal, anyways. I&rsquo;ve always felt there is a weird sort of magic being
able to type structured sentences into a text file, ram it through a compiler
(sometimes with fun, cryptic looking incantations typed into the terminal), and
seeing something come to life on the other end.</p>
<p>Programming has always been an on again/off again sort of hobby. I think it&rsquo;s
more the act of making something from nothing that draws me to it then actually
making something. A few years ago (actually closer to a decade, somehow) I found
the <a href="https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod">Complete Roguelike
Tutorial</a>
using Python and libtcod. I didn&rsquo;t know Python when I started the tutorial, but
the end result of that project was amazing - I had a mostly complete game. I
tweaked and customized, modified and played around with that project for a
while. Eventually hit a wall, probably due to my lack of knowledge with Python.</p>
<p>That project inspired me to try and learn C++, which I figured was a logical
leap since I had a pretty decent (completely informal and entirely from books)
set of skills with C. It didn&rsquo;t take long for me to want to attempt another
Roguelike.</p>
<p>That project was called <a href="/tags/barbarian/">Barbarian</a>, and it was a lot of fun
to work on - and probably the closest I&rsquo;ve came to making a start at &ldquo;the game&rdquo;
I wanted to make as a kid. I never really felt comfortable with my C++ knowledge
though, and the project had issues I was never able to quite wrap my head around
fixing. A thing most books don&rsquo;t teach is how to actually &ldquo;build&rdquo; software, and
my conclusion was that most of Barbarian&rsquo;s code problems were architectural.</p>
<p>I think programming is like building a model out of legos. You start with little
pieces, and eventually you make a part that then connects to other parts. If
you&rsquo;re really good, the legos you make are reusable. There&rsquo;s certain (well
documented) patterns and strategies to make parts of your software that if you
adapt well, you can make them into anything. I went back into C programming to
learn more basic skills and patterns, and again, what better place to practice
all these little components then in a roguelike? A long, rambling sort of
introduction to my latest project. I started working last year on a roguelike,
but this time with a &ldquo;clear&rdquo; end goal.</p>
<p>The project was supposed to be simple - a dungeon dive with a set number of
levels. Get to the bottom, kill the chief, get out. After that was accomplished,
I could use the project as a sandbox to play with all my other ideas. I named
this project <strong>Goblin Caves</strong> - the burly hero of this adventure is sent to slay
a Goblin Chief, who sits on his throne at the bottom of a labyrinthine cavern.</p>
<div id="ltbox-div">
    <div class="ltbox-gallery-row">
        
        <div class="ltbox-gallery-col">
            <a data-fancybox="gallery"
               data-loop="true"
               data-buttons='["zoom","fullScreen","close"]'
               data-animation-effect="false" href="/images/2023-11-04/Title.jpg">

    </div>
</div>

<p>Currently, the project runs right in the terminal and uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a> to render everything. One of
the major goals is to make sure to not tie the game to ncurses - I may
eventually use SDL to draw everything on a window instead, which would be more
portable and more consistent. The entire project is hand rolled, and uses no
external libraries, other than ncurses and the system stuff. I wrote all of it,
and tried my best to keep things as generic as possible.</p>

<p>I hit a snag last year, and it was a problem I had never solved in other
projects: time management. It&rsquo;s no fun if you and a goblin take turns whacking
at each other in lockstep - some goblins should be really fast, and some should
be slow. Your player should be able to speed up and slow down - from something
in the environment, a poison, a potion. When the bat swoops down from the
ceiling it should be able to attack a couple of times before you get a chance to
react.</p>
<p>The way the game loop is structured is straight out of <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html">Game Programming
Patterns</a>, basically the
engine does the following things in a constant loop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle Events</li>
<li>Update</li>
<li>Draw</li>
</ul>
<p>Events are (in this project, and most of my projects) things like keyboard
presses, game state changes, etc. When the player presses a key, it&rsquo;s read here
and then interpreted in the player&rsquo;s update routine. Update is the big function,
and is responsible for translating the player&rsquo;s keypress into an action taken by
their avatar, a selection on a menu screen, or initiating a change in game
state. Draw is where all of this action is then translated into glyphs that are
then placed on the screen, showing the player the game.</p>
<p>Now, since this is a turn based game, all the entities that are
not the player don&rsquo;t update until after the player takes their turn. So the
update/draw loop has to run until the player can take their turn again. Each
&ldquo;tick&rdquo; through the loop checks all the actors (player/enemies) and if they can
take a turn, they take it. Otherwise, they gain  a set amount of energy. Then,
when the player can take a turn, the update/draw loop breaks, and waits for the
player&rsquo;s input. Easy enough right? Well, when would animations play? What
happens when the actor list is bigger, or the monsters have more complex
behavior?</p>
<p>So, the solution is this: the update loop checks the player first, if they can
take their turn it doesn&rsquo;t update the rest of the actors. Player takes their
turn, spends energy. Now, when update is called again, the player doesn&rsquo;t have
the energy to take another turn, so they are granted a unit of energy. The game
then proceeds through the rest of the actors - taking turns and spending energy
immediately if they have enough to act, and giving a unit of energy if they
don&rsquo;t. Now, if (when) animations and sound are added, update can play them
immediately. Psuedocode:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C">engine() {
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span>(running) {
        handle_events();
        update();
        draw();
    }
}
update() {
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span>(can_take_turn(player) <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span>;
    update_monster(player); <span style="color:#75715e">// Checks if player is dead, has moved, etc
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span>(i <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>; i <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> monster_list.length; i<span style="color:#f92672">++</span>) {
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span>(can_take_turn(monster_list[i]) {
            take_turn(monster_list[i];
        } <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span> {
            grant_energy(monster_list[i];
        }
        update_monster(monster_list[i]);
    }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Well, that <strong>should</strong> work. Except, remember how I said I wasn&rsquo;t going to tie
things to ncurses? Well, checking for keyboard input blocks the loop from
advancing with the way that routine is set up. And, for some reason I set up the
<code>draw()</code> routine to call ncurses directly, instead of just changing glyphs on a
fake screen, then drawing that fake screen once a loop. A temporary work around
that is currently in place (until I fix the silliness I wrote in with ncurses)
is that update loops until the player can take their turn, then breaks and waits
for input. This causes monsters to &ldquo;jump&rdquo; around and not be where the player
thinks they are (since draw isn&rsquo;t called at the right time). Adding <code>draw()</code>
into this temporary loop breaks the display of game messages&hellip;</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at with the project now - divorcing the game from
ncurses. The way everything should work should be completely independent from
ncurses - even though I have no intention of doing actual tiles/graphics for
this game, I want the possibility to eventually have a command line switch for
an SDL interface. A few more screenshots featuring my attempts at ASCII art:</p>

<p>Some goals I wrote for myself when I started this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the game limited to 4 (or 5) major data types: Monster, Tile, Effects,
Pickups. Currently, the player is a monster, but eventually it might be it&rsquo;s
own thing.</li>
<li>Saving/Loading, dungeon persistence (you can go back up stairs and return to a
level you were at previously). I finished this part already, and it was
really not as complicated as I previously understood. Maybe a side effect of
doing this in C (and not C++)?</li>
<li>Map generation. Procedural levels, destructible tiles, pre-made &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; (like
ADOM&rsquo;s vaults), dynamic field-of-view. This is the fun part, so naturally bits
and pieces of it exist in some form or another. Whenever I get tired of doing
something, I find myself here tweaking and adding stuff in.</li>
<li>Time management - where I got stuck last year, and the thing I am currently
working on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the long wishlist items of things I want to implement, eventually.
Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Player abilities - spells, weapon attacks.</li>
<li>Monster intelligence. Lots of ideas here, and none of them have been worked on
yet.</li>
<li>Procedurally generated flora</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>&ldquo;Flavor&rdquo; text procedurally generated, from chunks in an external file. This
would be amazing to accomplish - because then the game could be easily
translated to another language.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a little gameplay video, warts and all. You can see in the video that
the update/draw routine isn&rsquo;t quite right (players aren&rsquo;t where they should be).
The splatter after a goblin is smashed might need to be toned down a hair -
not sure if it&rsquo;s fun or excessive at this point.</p>

<p>The project is on <a href="https://github.com/zwilder/goblincaves">Github</a>, and I dump
all my ideas into a markdown file (<code>ideas.md</code>) on there. The <code>master</code> branch is
stable, and should work/build just fine on any flavor of Linux. The most recent
hare-brained ideas and work are on the <code>dev</code> branch.</p>
