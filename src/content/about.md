If you've arrived on this page, you may be wondering: Who are you? What is WSL? Why am I reading this?

I'm a hobbyist programmer, and have been messing around with various little programming projects since I was a kid borrowing books on C programming from the local library. I think I originally started programming because as a kid I had no way of actually buying computer games, and figured "heck, I could make something myself!" Like most kids, my interest and enthusiasm (and patience) fluctuated way too often to ever have any real results, and I eventually stopped making things when I left high school.

About ten years later, I was bored over a winter break in school and stumbled across the [Libtcod Python Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod) and decided that I would pick up this old hobby and learn Python. A few weeks of furious coding after the tutorial I ended up with something I was actually pretty proud of, my first "real" game! It was pretty okay, and actually pretty fun. Most of all, it was a great learning experience and was extremely motivating to try something else.

I have a weird obsession with making things from scratch - so naturally I decided to attempt to learn C++. This blog was created to document my struggles, successes, and failures attempting to mash C++ together into a cohesive program.

I'm currently working on a roguelike, written in C++. I do all of my code in [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) on [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/).

This website was created using [Hugo](/), the [XMin](/) theme, and some borrowed ideas from the internet.

## What is WSL?

It's short for "weasel" - Most of my ideas began as inspiration gained from watching too many cartoons - this one was from Cow and Chicken. Also, hilariously, it's the abbreviation for the World Surf League - which I am 100% not affiliated with, unless they want to hook me up with a t-shirt featuring a surfing mustelid or something.
