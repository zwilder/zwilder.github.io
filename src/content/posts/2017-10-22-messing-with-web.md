Ok, so it turns out I still can't stand using a premade theme. I decided to look again at Hugo themes, and found [XMin](https://xmin.yihui.name/). Clean, simple, and
a good basic idea of what I wanted this blog to look like. Cracked open the source code and was playing around... one thing led to another and
this is what I ended up with. 

Really enjoying working with Hugo - haven't even played with any of the cool powerful features that it has, but I am very impressed with how easy it is
to modify and change things. Everything is laid out in a good, logical sense which makes it much easier to customize and play around with things. 

Things that still need work:

* I'm not sure about the monospace font for the titles and headers - I like it, but that doesn't mean it looks good! Ha.

* The [Tags](/tags) page looks off. Not sure what to do with that.

* Maybe write some sort of intro thing for the home page.

Most likely I'll end up redoing this whole layout... But this was the first time I've messed around with web design stuff and had a bit of success and didn't
pull out too many hairs! Thanks Hugo!
