      <description>As a kid, I wanted to learn how to program to make computer games. That was the original goal, anyways. I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt there is a weird sort of magic being able to type structured sentences into a text file, ram it through a compiler (sometimes with fun, cryptic looking incantations typed into the terminal), and seeing something come to life on the other end.
Programming has always been an on again/off again sort of hobby. I think it&amp;rsquo;s more the act of making something from nothing that draws me to it then actually making something. A few years ago (actually closer to a decade, somehow) I found the Complete Roguelike Tutorial using Python and libtcod.</description>
