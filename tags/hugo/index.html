    <p style="margin: 5px;">
    Ok, so it turns out I still can&rsquo;t stand using a premade theme. I decided to look again at Hugo themes, and found XMin. Clean, simple, and a good basic idea of what I wanted this blog to look like. Cracked open the source code and was playing around&hellip; one thing led to another and this is what I ended up with.
Really enjoying working with Hugo - haven&rsquo;t even played with any of the cool powerful features that it has, but I am very impressed with how easy it is to modify and change things.

    Man, I really don&rsquo;t do a lot of work on this blog - maybe because I am not a web programmer but I can see when this blog does not look very good.
Well, I officially gave up on web design. Yep! Turns out, I should probably leave that to the professionals. Oh, and I also decided to heck with Jekyll. It was cool, and worked well - but searching for a premade Jekyll theme was a chore.
