      <description>The one bad thing about hosting a static blog is that implementing comments means you:
 Outsource, letting some other site handle it (like Disqus) Come up with some sort of crazy contraption to force a comment system into a static blog Spend hours scouring the internet to see what other people have done.  Obviously, outsourcing wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option - Disqus looks nice and all, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure it would be fine for a lot of people, but it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I wanted.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to fix this blog for a while now, and I decided in the process that I am awful at web design/programming. Haha, well, the first step to being kinda good at something is kinda sucking at something, right?
In my scouring of the internet I discovered that a lot of static blog sites used Jekyll to generate their site. At first, I figured it was nothing more than another insta-blog program where you just dump some content into a folder and it spits out a blog - but holy cow it is so much more than (and can be exactly) that.</description>
