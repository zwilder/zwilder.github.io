      <description>Background Lead tree, river tamarind, faux mimosa - Travel through just about any alleyway in the Phoenix metro area and you are sure to come across this tree. It will usually be loaded with reddish, thin seedpods and likely have many small lead trees around it. Native to southern Mexico, it was originally planted as an ornamental here during the 1970s and 1980s. Supposedly, the tree was promoted as a &amp;ldquo;miracle tree&amp;rdquo; with many uses for the pods and wood. The bark (like many trees) was used in folk medicine to help relieve pain. Some Asian countries (particularly Laos and Indonesia) imported it and incorporated its prolific seed pods into various food dishes.</description>
