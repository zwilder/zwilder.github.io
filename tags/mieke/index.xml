      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell stories about someone who means so much to you, who has left a
massive mark on your life, and whose presence will be missed more than I can
possibly describe. I decided the best way was to just start at the beginning,
and write stories as I thought of them. This is the first in a series of posts
about Mieke, starting at the beginning and roughly chronicling the past 13
years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
