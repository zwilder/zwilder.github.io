            At the time of writing this, I&rsquo;m sitting in a small camper trailer just off the Pacific ocean in Oregon. Rain is drizzling down in intermittent bursts, pounding on the metal roof, and when the rain stops a jay outside starts &ldquo;singing&rdquo; his boisterous song.
I&rsquo;ve recently relocated to the Pacific Northwest - my job had a position that needed filling on the Oregon Coast, how could I turn down that opportunity? With little time to prepare, my wife and I packed and shoved things into shipping containers to migrate our life across the country and put our house up for sale. I started work in OR on May 3rd, flying out ahead of my wife and daughter to scope the place out and look for a new place to live. The house in AZ is currently under contract, and set to close on June 15th&hellip; So I&rsquo;ve been living in this trailer in the woods by myself for the last month.
There really is no shortage of stuff to do up here - especially being on the coast and with the weather so dang nice compared to AZ. One of the projects lingering in my mind for the past year or so was starting a new blog. Something to encompass all my hobbies, adventures, short essays on nature things and random stories. Basically, a combination and condensation of my other blog projects along with other things that I haven&rsquo;t really posted anywhere online.
A one-stop Zach shop.
So, what you&rsquo;ll find here, in the previous posts, is things written by myself and a coworker on my old &ldquo;Hidden Phoenix&rdquo; blog, and all the posts from my programming blog. I&rsquo;ll be posting new stories from Oregon here, and occasionally write-ups of things I find interesting. You&rsquo;ll also be seeing posts featuring things I&rsquo;ve made - sewing projects, MYOG camping stuff, art, etc.
 One thing that I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for a while is sketch more. I want to get out and &ldquo;art&rdquo; more - no real excuses for not doing it. With all my free time over the last month, and the fact that a lot of places were shut down because of the health crisis, I ran out of bullshit excuses and got out and did it.
