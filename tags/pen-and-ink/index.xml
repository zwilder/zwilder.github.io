      <description>At the time of writing this, I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in a small camper trailer just off the Pacific ocean in Oregon. Rain is drizzling down in intermittent bursts, pounding on the metal roof, and when the rain stops a jay outside starts &amp;ldquo;singing&amp;rdquo; his boisterous song.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently relocated to the Pacific Northwest - my job had a position that needed filling on the Oregon Coast, how could I turn down that opportunity? With little time to prepare, my wife and I packed and shoved things into shipping containers to migrate our life across the country and put our house up for sale. I started work in OR on May 3rd, flying out ahead of my wife and daughter to scope the place out and look for a new place to live. The house in AZ is currently under contract, and set to close on June 15th&amp;hellip; So I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in this trailer in the woods by myself for the last month.</description>
