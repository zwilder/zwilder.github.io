    <p style="margin: 5px;">
    Last year r/roguelikedev did a really cool thing with a weekly post where everyone followed along with a tutorial, shared ideas and problems, and motivated each other to actually finish a project. Well they&rsquo;re doing it again this year, and with the announcement last week I decided to take a look at the new and improved, Python3 version of the tutorial.
For those not familiar with this famous tutorial - each part covers a small chunk of building a roguelike using simple language and easy to follow code.

    <p style="margin: 5px;">
    Man, I really don&rsquo;t do a lot of work on this blog - maybe because I am not a web programmer but I can see when this blog does not look very good.
Well, I officially gave up on web design. Yep! Turns out, I should probably leave that to the professionals. Oh, and I also decided to heck with Jekyll. It was cool, and worked well - but searching for a premade Jekyll theme was a chore.

    <p style="margin: 5px;">
    Over the past couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been working on simplifying the code for my roguelike project - heavily inspired by one of my favorite books on my shelf, Game Programming Patterns.
I&rsquo;ve seriously read this book cover to cover, multiple times - and every time find a new use for one of the &lsquo;patterns&rsquo; in it. I just discovered that the author&rsquo;s blog has a bunch of good reads on it as well.

    <p style="margin: 5px;">
    So, every time I get the urge to write a blog post about whatever random bit of code I&rsquo;m writing - I look at the blog and think: &ldquo;Hm, this is kinda ugly.&rdquo; Then, I have to rewrite it until I&rsquo;m mostly satisfied with how it looks.
Recently, I&rsquo;ve been working on writing a nice little interface for handling menus and other parts of the UI for my roguelike project. Unfortunately, like the layout of this blog, I can&rsquo;t seem to find a satisfactory &lsquo;look and feel&rsquo; - I think I&rsquo;ve got a good start though.

    <p style="margin: 5px;">
    Continuing in my never-ending project to make a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; roguelike in C++, I decided to tackle something I have never before tried: artificial intelligence. My first rough idea was to implement some sort of component-type system, and build the AI up like I built up entities. This turned out to be far too complicated, and even getting a monster to move randomly was a chore. Obviously, this wasn&rsquo;t going to work.
