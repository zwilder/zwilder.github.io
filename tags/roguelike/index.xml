      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I wanted to learn how to program to make computer games. That was the
original goal, anyways. I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt there is a weird sort of magic being
able to type structured sentences into a text file, ram it through a compiler
(sometimes with fun, cryptic looking incantations typed into the terminal), and
seeing something come to life on the other end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming has always been an on again/off again sort of hobby. I think it&amp;rsquo;s
more the act of making something from nothing that draws me to it then actually
making something. A few years ago (actually closer to a decade, somehow) I found
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod&#34;&gt;Complete Roguelike
Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;
using Python and libtcod. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Python when I started the tutorial, but
the end result of that project was amazing - I had a mostly complete game. I
tweaked and customized, modified and played around with that project for a
while. Eventually hit a wall, probably due to my lack of knowledge with Python.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>One of the big goals for Barbarian and one of the coolest things on my to do list was to add animations into the game. How exciting is it to see an arrow flying toward your character, a firebolt explode in the face of an undead horde, blood splatter flying from the wounds inflicted by the mighty barbarian decorating the walls of the dungeon?
Obviously, the excitement added by all these visual effects is well worth the time spent adding them in. I started thinking about how I wanted to incorporate animations during the Tutorial Tuesday Challenge, and started jotting implementation ideas down in my notebook almost two months ago. For the life of me I could not find a good writeup on creating procedural explosions on a 2d grid, and could not wrap my head around how to make them look decent. I shared my struggles on the r/roguelikedev sharing Saturday post, and another dev (u/darkgnostic) gave me some fantastic ideas about reusing my line-of-sight code. So, armed with this knowledge I sat down last week and decided to finally try some of my implementation ideas.
The idea was simple, for each frame expand outward from the origin of the explosion to a set radius.
The Framework In order to test this out, I needed to actually get the animations working. Like most bits of code that I only have a vague idea of how to accomplish I started at the top: Engine::update() and Engine::draw() should loop through a list of animations, updating and drawing them. Easy enough to draw them, just need an Animation::draw() routine. Update would be similar, but would need to know how much time had passed since the last update. To get this, I needed to visit the main loop code
 something that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been looked at in quite a while.  Cracked open main.cpp, dusted it off and examined my loop. Previously the game was limited to 60fps by using a call to sleep the thread - definitely gross and in need of some work. Where had I seen a beautiful, simple game loop before?</description>

      <description>Over the course of the 2018 r/roguelikedev Tutorial Tuesday Challenge I decided to invest some time learning some fundamental programming concepts that I probably should have learned years ago. The fun (and challenging) part of being a hobby programmer is that most of my learning comes from books, and then random tutorials on the internet. Somewhere in the course of my &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo; I never learned about basic data structures and how they can be used.
Around week three of the challenge I decided to implement a scheduling system for Barbarian - which led me to learn about creating lists and priority queues. STL has std::priority_queue, but like many STL classes never seems to want to play nicely with my code. Again, likely a byproduct of me learning C++ from a book and probably not the fault of STL.
This is my very first attempt at writing a tutorial - expect some errors and feel free to comment with any corrections. I will absolutely guarantee that there is probably a better way of doing what I&amp;rsquo;ve written here, so don&amp;rsquo;t read this as gospel.
Making a List A list is a fantastic data structure - and is so simple to implement I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why it was never included in the beginning programming books I have read. A list is an ordered collection of nodes, where each node has some data and a pointer to the next node. The list has a head and a tail - the very first and very last nodes in the list. That&amp;rsquo;s it! That&amp;rsquo;s all they are.
Head A ---&amp;gt; B ---&amp;gt; C &amp;lt;- Node 1 2 3 &amp;lt;- Data Tail Definining a node is simple, and using the power of C++ templates you can make a node hold any data you can imagine!
template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt; class Node { public: Node(T d) : data(d) { next = NULL; prev = NULL; } T data; Node * next; Node * prev; };  Then to create the list all we need is a couple of functions - one to add nodes and one to remove nodes.</description>

      <title>The Roguelike Tutorial - Week 7</title>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of coding over the last week, but I did finish the challenge! Had a bit of a scare after finishing part 12, I found a horrible lurking bug in the program that caused a LOT of little errors and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure (at first) how to track it down. Basically, shortly after finishing adding in some cool randomization functions I found that some entities weren&amp;rsquo;t being copied correctly, or saved correctly. Turns out, the C++ Rule of 3/5/0 is actually a rule and not just a suggestion/guideline.
This project was the first time I attempted to use smart pointers and write more &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; C++ code, and apparently even when using smart pointers to allocate memory you should write at least a copy constructor and copy assignment function. I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure what I would put in a custom destructor if all the memory that&amp;rsquo;s allocated is done via smart pointers, and that might be something I need to clean up now the challenge is over.
When the Entity class was created with the default copy constructor (or copy assignment), it wasn&amp;rsquo;t allocating new memory for the new entity. So, when one entity was destroyed another entity would suddenly lose it&amp;rsquo;s components! This never was a problem before part 12, because I never tried to duplicate entities. One of the main goals in part 12 was to intelligently place monsters, and I implemented that with a weighted list that contained a prototype entity which was duplicated each time one of those enemies was placed. All of a sudden, enemies suddenly couldn&amp;rsquo;t die after the first one was killed. Pathfinding spontaneously broke. Entity names started being displayed as gibberish. I seriously thought I was going to have to scrap the project at this point, because I had no idea where to begin solving this problem. The answer eventually came to me at work, and getting everything smoothed out was pretty trivial.
Part 12 So the theme of part 12 was to start implementing more randomization functions. Up until this week I was using the built in STL version of mersenne twister, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think the way I was using it was the most effective or how it was designed to be used.</description>

      <description>Oh man, this has been a super exciting and productive week - this project is starting to feel like a real game! Started off last week a bit behind schedule, having just finished part 8. After my rant last week about my source code files getting too long, I decided to spend a bit of time going back over my core classes and cleaning up the code. I also split Engine into multiple files - which ended up making a lot of things a lot easier. Heck, recompiling a huge source file each time I make a minor change was tedious, and the time savings alone was worth splitting the files. Each of the Engine main functions now has it’s own file, and then each of those main functions calls separate routines depending on what GameState the game is in. Each of those separate, state specific functions has its own file. Code that’s reused between routines lives in the main function file.
I think it’s pretty cool - makes finding and changing things easier. I also noticed that this project is now more than twice the length (lines of code) of any project I’ve done so far. This weeks post was originally intended to cover just part 9, but I threw 10 and 11 in as well since they were relatively short.
Part 9 - Targeting I wasn’t sure when I started this part how I would go about doing it. Style-wise, I like the way ADOM and Angband handling targeting with the auto select target and keyboard interface. Using a mouse feels weird to me when playing roguelikes, so I knew I didn’t want to stick to the ideas in the Python tutorial. The game engine is already set up to handle different game states, but targeting isn’t really a state - more of a miniature loop with it’s own events and draw cycle.
So, I decided to make targeting exactly that - a game state that isn’t really a state, but a miniature replica of the main game loop. When a function (any function) calls Engine::target() the game saves the current state, and starts it’s own loop.</description>

      <description>Another very productive week for this project! Although I was unable to finish last weeks goals of getting Parts 8 and 9 completed by today, I still feel pretty darn good about what I did accomplish. Besides, Parts 10, 11, and 12 are all fairly simple - heck the code is already in place, just needs to actually be used!
After finishing Part 7 last week I decided to try and fix/change a few things that have been bothering me. The square, 12x12 font, looked great for the map tiles but it was really ugly for text. I figured my alternatives were to either use two fonts (like a 6x12 for text and a 12x12 for map), or just use a different font altogether. All my years playing games in a terminal window pushed me to the second option - if it’s good enough for the best roguelikes, it’s good enough for me! The only difficulty with this option is that if I ever want to add graphical tiles easily, I’d have to make the tiles in a strange size (ie 9x14 instead of 16x16). Adding graphical tiles in will be a chore anyways, so I’ll just go ahead and not worry about it now. This is what the game looks like now:
  Pretty slick! After changing to a nice 9x14 font, I decided to tackle another minor improvement that makes a huge impact: fullscreen mode! First, I had to set the game window to a standard resolution (800x600), and then center the console in that window. Easy enough. Conveniently SDL has a super cool built in function to turn on fullscreen! Oddly, it doesn’t work at all. Maybe a fault with my code, maybe a fault with SDL. Not sure, but google showed me that a bunch of people have the same issue - and very few people had work-arounds. The solution I chose to go with is to make the window a bit larger than the computer desktop resolution, and then center it. So, it’s very much a fake fullscreen, but it works and looks darn nice.</description>

      <title>The Roguelike Tutorial - Week 4</title>
      <link>/posts/2018-07-18-the-roguelike-tutorial-week4/</link>

      <description>The past week has been equal parts frustration and excitement with this project. I ran into a pretty common design problem: entity components need to know about the rest of the game. Well, since each entity is just a collection of components it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be difficult to pass a pointer to the game engine. Then, the components would have a pointer to the entity that &amp;ldquo;owns&amp;rdquo; it. Simple and clean&amp;hellip; or so I thought. This didn&amp;rsquo;t work, at all. Individual entities could access the engine just fine, but the components just could not access anything about their owner. Even trying to print the address of the owner caused the game to segfault and crash. GDB was no help, and I tried MANY things to get this to work.
I realized that I was bashing my head against this problem, and totally stumped, so I decided to work on something else. I changed the Engine&amp;rsquo;s entity list from a std::vector&amp;lt;Entity&amp;gt; to a wsl::DLList&amp;lt;Entity&amp;gt; (from the fancy list class I created last week). To my surprise and delight, it worked perfectly! What&amp;rsquo;s nice about using the list I created is that it manages it&amp;rsquo;s own memory - I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about allocations/deallocations no matter how big the list gets!
This got me thinking about best practices and clean code again. In general, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard you should always use the Standard Template Library containers over a custom rolled solution. However, I know my code, I know how it works, and I can fix/change it with minimal fuss. Creating a custom wrapper for std::priority_queue or std::map? No way, I have no idea where to even begin!
So, with this in mind I returned to my original problem. To hell with best practice, I&amp;rsquo;m not a professional and I don&amp;rsquo;t work with other programmers. My code is written clearly and commented well, so it should be easy to figure out why I did things the way I did. I decided that a good, bare bones, no frills system has components that are nothing more than data containers, and entities that are collections of components.</description>

      <title>The Roguelike Tutorial - Week 3b</title>

      <description>I originally planned for this week&amp;rsquo;s blog post to cover my adaptation of part 5 of the Python RL tutorial - but after finishing part 5 in a matter of minutes I realized there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much to write here! Part 5 is basically making new entities and getting the collision logic in place before combat is added in part 6. However, before adding combat I thought it would be beneficial to start thinking about game time - it&amp;rsquo;s far more fun when some enemies are a lot quicker than the player, forcing the player to devise strategies for survival.
Naturally, there&amp;rsquo;s a few articles on roguebasin - one of which I&amp;rsquo;ve read many times over the years, and never understood a word of it. Pascal is a goofy, blunt looking language and really makes you appreciate how nice programming languages read these days. Or, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just dense and don&amp;rsquo;t get it. I love that article though - not only because it references my favorite roguelike ADOM(which, despite playing for over a decade have never beat), but because of the word &amp;ldquo;elegant.&amp;rdquo; It just sounds so, appealing.
I sat down, notebook ready, to try and break this article in pieces and figure out what it&amp;rsquo;s saying. The very first thing it says is:
 Readers should be familiar with a linked list (next) and doubly-linked list (prev and next). A circular list simply means that the last object&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;next&amp;rdquo; points to the first object; and in a doubly-linked circular list the first object&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;prev&amp;rdquo; points to the last object. The advantage of a circular list over a regular list is that a circular list need not cater for null-references during insertion or deletion of objects.
 Well, my severe lack of formal computer science education meant that I had no idea what any of those things are, really, beyond the fact that they exist and there is likely an STL implementation of those I could find. Searching google for &amp;ldquo;linked list C++&amp;rdquo; led me to this fantastic site.
I decided to take a step back from this project at this point and learn all about lists.</description>

      <description>I decided to split the third week into two separate posts so that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ramble on as long as last week. Over the past week I continued fighting the BSP dungeon generator I had attempted to write the week prior, and gave up again. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably revisit the dungeon generator later, and will definitely write something about whatever I end up doing. The artificial deadlines imposed by following along with the rest of r/roguelikedev really helps motivate me to call something &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; and move on&amp;hellip; Heck, I think I could be satisfied just tinkering with dungeon generators and never moving on to actually making this a playable game!
I did some reading on writing clean C++ by google, which prompted me to take another look at the code I&amp;rsquo;ve already written. The big thing I gleaned from the Google article was to avoid &amp;ldquo;in-lining&amp;rdquo; things in headers, and put most of the code in the implementation. This is something I thought I did already, but apparently using non-trivial types inline in headers is bad for performance. This means stuff like this is OK:
class Foo { public: ... const int &amp;amp; count() { return count_; } ... private: int count_; };  However, doing this is not: class Bar { public: ... Foo badFunc() { return data_; } ... private: Foo data_; }; 
Along the same lines, Google recommends not to inline constructors/destructors with non-trivial types. This is something I did in almost every header file in the game! Fortunately, since this program is still relatively small, the changes to my code were easy enough to implement.
So the first challenge for this week was to implement a &amp;ldquo;field of view&amp;rdquo; for our dungeon delving barbarian. Two options I considered for this were following along with the original Rogue or using Bresenham&amp;rsquo;s line drawing algorithm. The original Rogue showed the entirety of whichever room the player was in, and kept track of explored areas. Field of view using line drawing basically illuminates a radius around the player, while intelligently stopping sight from passing through walls and other obstructions.</description>

      <description>So this week&amp;rsquo;s goal is to finish part 2 and part 3 of the tutorial - I worked ahead because I was excited to get this project going, which worked out well since shortly after finishing part 2 I switched to SDL from SFML and it gave me some time to work on this blog.
The Switch to SDL So the game logic is completely divorced from the rendering system - I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be tied into using a set framework if I want to change later, and I know for a fact from previous projects this will make save files much easier to generate. I briefly described last week that the game has a virtual console that is written to, and is read/translated into graphics to be displayed by SFML. Well, the console is a grid of say, 80x50 (960px x 600px). Each cell in the grid has a glyph that needs to be translated and rendered. During engine initialization, it loads one texture (image) as the spritesheet - in this case it&amp;rsquo;s a .png image of the CP437 font.
  Now what Engine::Draw() did originally was make a new SFML sprite for each cell, with the position set to the font size multiplied by the cell x,y coordinates. Seemed simple enough, and it worked - but that&amp;rsquo;s 4000 sprites created and destroyed EVERY time Draw() is called. The next iteration created two arrays of sprites in Engine::Init() that were persistent and lived throughout the life of the program - one sprite for each cell in an array, and one for each glyph. Then, in draw, each cell&amp;rsquo;s sprite was just changed to be the same value as the sprite representing the glyph on the console. Yep, that worked too, but it still seemed there had to be a cleaner, better way of doing this.
I realized something shortly after finishing that, I don&amp;rsquo;t need all those sprites. I could just create an array of rectangles representing the sprite location on the texture and then change each cell&amp;rsquo;s sprite location in that array! Further, doing this I didn&amp;rsquo;t really need 4000 sprites (one for each cell) - couldn&amp;rsquo;t I just use one sprite, updating it&amp;rsquo;s position and rectangle before drawing it, since I only clear the render surface before drawing the first time?</description>

      <description>Last year r/roguelikedev did a really cool thing with a weekly post where everyone followed along with a tutorial, shared ideas and problems, and motivated each other to actually finish a project. Well they&amp;rsquo;re doing it again this year, and with the announcement last week I decided to take a look at the new and improved, Python3 version of the tutorial.
For those not familiar with this famous tutorial - each part covers a small chunk of building a roguelike using simple language and easy to follow code. In just 13 parts you have a working roguelike to build off of and branch out from. A really, really cool idea. I did the old Python2 version a couple years back, and it blew my mind. After completing the last part I finally had made a game, and was pretty proud of the results. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Python when I started, and hadn&amp;rsquo;t done any coding before beginning, but was able to follow along and even add my own stuff along the way. Eventually, my lack of knowledge caught up with me and my bloated single file Python program started to become difficult to modify and maintain. I took a step back, and decided to start relearning C and then ventured into C++.
I quickly found that I actually really enjoy more of the building of the game than the designing of the game. Which, is cool because the amount of things to build and the resources available for building things from scratch are darn near infinite - especially with the knowledge of the internet at my fingertips. It is not, however, conducive to finishing a project or making something playable.
As I read through the new and improved tutorial, I realized something pretty amazing: I could build this in C++. Reading each part I could think of ways (plural!) that I could accomplish the same thing, but with my own code. So, I decided to play along with the tutorial, and force myself to follow the deadlines - a week for each part.
I decided to start posting this to the blog after I had finished Parts 0 - 3, which covers weeks one and two - so I&amp;rsquo;ve written a brief summary of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done in parts 1 and 2 of the tutorial so far.</description>

      <description>Man, I really don&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of work on this blog - maybe because I am not a web programmer but I can see when this blog does not look very good.
Well, I officially gave up on web design. Yep! Turns out, I should probably leave that to the professionals. Oh, and I also decided to heck with Jekyll. It was cool, and worked well - but searching for a premade Jekyll theme was a chore. Not to mention getting all the silly ruby nonsense to work. Even tried playing around with Ruby and seeing what all the fuss was about. No thanks.
Stumbled upon Hu(go) - another static blog generator. Well, Hu(go) is blazingly fast, and has a ton of cool features that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to even try hard to get to work. Not to mention the themes are easily searched through, easily switched, easily customized/expanded, and look darn good. So, for now, this is what the blog will look like - A theme called Hemmingway powered by Hugo. I also caved and signed up for Disqus, to handle comments. It really is so much easier using premade tools, haha.
&amp;ndash;
In other news, I continued the process of learning C++ by programming in C++ and made a bit of progress on my rougelike attempt. I had a revelation while working one day about how the &amp;ldquo;engine&amp;rdquo; should be structured: Everything manages its own shit and nothing else. No exceptions. But, you ask, how will my keypresses to move the player work? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t the game engine have to interpret those key presses and then tell the game state to move the player, and then the player respond with&amp;hellip;
No. Doing that causes all sorts of crazy dependencies and connections that do not have to exist.
My solution?
  Engine manages a stack of states. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really know what a state is, just that it has them, and that it can add states to itself and remove states from itself. The engine is responsible for interacting with the computer and reading user input.
  Each state manages a stack of windows.</description>

      <description>Over the past couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on simplifying the code for my roguelike project - heavily inspired by one of my favorite books on my shelf, Game Programming Patterns.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seriously read this book cover to cover, multiple times - and every time find a new use for one of the &amp;lsquo;patterns&amp;rsquo; in it. I just discovered that the author&amp;rsquo;s blog has a bunch of good reads on it as well. One of the biggest problems I&amp;rsquo;ve had with the roguelike project was a simple way to issue commands (which should have been a clue) from the player to the character, and from the computer AI to the enemies.
The first chapter in the book, and this blog post had the answer - the &amp;lsquo;Command&amp;rsquo; pattern. I have no idea how I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of this sooner - basically, all the actions that an actor (player or enemy) can take are issued as &amp;lsquo;commands&amp;rsquo;. A command is just a subclass of an action, and each actor when updating gets to call it&amp;rsquo;s most current action&amp;rsquo;s perform() routine. What makes this super cool and useful is that the perform routine returns an ActionResult, which has a flag stating whether or not the current action was successful, and a suggested alternate action (for use if the action was unsuccessful).
class Action { public: virtual ActionResult perform(Actor &amp;amp; actor) = 0; protected: Action() { } }; class ActionResult { public: ActionResult() { status_ = true; } bool success() { return status_; } void setFalse() { status_ = false; } void setTrue() { status_ = true; } Action * getAlternate() { return alternative_; } void setAlternate(Action * alternate) { alternative_ = alternate; } private: Action * alternative_; bool status_; };  Now, if the player moves into a square - instead of the keypress moving the player, the keypress just sets the player&amp;rsquo;s next action to attack in the direction of that tile. During the players update, the perform() for the attack action checks to see if there is another actor there - and if there isn&amp;rsquo;t returns a move action as an alternate.</description>

      <title>Randomly Generated Caves with Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>So, every time I get the urge to write a blog post about whatever random bit of code I&amp;rsquo;m writing - I look at the blog and think: &amp;ldquo;Hm, this is kinda ugly.&amp;rdquo; Then, I have to rewrite it until I&amp;rsquo;m mostly satisfied with how it looks.
Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on writing a nice little interface for handling menus and other parts of the UI for my roguelike project. Unfortunately, like the layout of this blog, I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find a satisfactory &amp;lsquo;look and feel&amp;rsquo; - I think I&amp;rsquo;ve got a good start though.
While procrastinating working on that, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time thinking about the map, and my ECS system. At the risk of prematurely optimizing code, it seems like an awful waste of space to make every tile an entity. Most of a tiles properties are simple boolean flags anyways, so why not make tiles just a bitflag and glyph to represent them? After running some halfassed tests on this idea, the size of an entire map (100x100, or 10,000 tiles) worth of tiles was a mere 24 bytes. Yeah, this idea will work just fine.
Basically, how it works now is a tile is just: struct Tile { int bitMask; char glyph; } 
And the flags: enum TileFlags : int { NONE = 0, BLOCKS_MOVEMENT = 0x001, BLOCKS_LIGHT = 0x002, UP_STAIR = 0x004, DOWN_STAIR = 0x008, DOOR = 0x010, FLOOR = 0x020 }; 
I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty huge fan of bitflags, mostly because it allows me to do all sorts of cool stuff. Say for instance we added a LIQUID flag to TileFlags - liquid blocks movement (our fearless adventurer never took swim lessons, apparently) but doesn&amp;rsquo;t block light, so the adventurer&amp;rsquo;s field of vision would see over the murky pool of whatever liquid.
But wait! It gets better, what if our adventurer decides that, while standing next to a murky pool of water, to read a Scroll of Explosion - The game logic can now easily test to see if any of the affected tiles are also liquid, and make steam that the player CAN&amp;rsquo;T see through!</description>

      <title>Fun With Dijkstra Mapping</title>

      <description>Continuing in my never-ending project to make a &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; roguelike in C++, I decided to tackle something I have never before tried: artificial intelligence. My first rough idea was to implement some sort of component-type system, and build the AI up like I built up entities. This turned out to be far too complicated, and even getting a monster to move randomly was a chore. Obviously, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work.
After browsing /r/roguelikedev and RogueBasin I came across a few articles on &amp;ldquo;need driven AI&amp;rdquo; - an absurdly cool concept, and so (seemingly) simple to implement I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how I didn&amp;rsquo;t stumble across this earlier. Basically, creatures in the game assign a value to things they know about (treasure, the player, exits, other monsters they are friendly with, other monsters they are terrified of, etc. etc.) and make an &amp;lsquo;informed&amp;rsquo; decision about where to move next. A monster could desire killing the player over treasure, and would &amp;ldquo;decide&amp;rdquo; to move towards the player instead of a closer pile of gold. Maybe that monster is a pack hunter, and also strongly desires to be near it&amp;rsquo;s pack - so when singled out it moves away to regroup with others. Cats could hunt mice, the undead could wander aimlessly attacking anything, golems could guard exits, archers could stay a safe distance away, and
&amp;hellip;
Clearly, this idea has so many uses that I absolutely had to attempt an implementation in my game. The best article I found describing what I hope to accomplish was written by the creator of the awesome Brogue, and talked about something called &amp;ldquo;Dijkstra mapping.&amp;rdquo; A number on a Dijkstra map is the shortest distance from that tile to the goal. Moving from any numbered tile to any lower numbered tile adjacent will take you on the shortest path to the goal. Using this technique I could also accomplish intelligent pathfinding (another thing I&amp;rsquo;ve never been quite able to do on my own). So,	the first step was to write up something to generate these maps.
After much confusion (I&amp;rsquo;m still not much of a C++ programmer), I ended up with a fairly simple and straightforward set of code to generate a vector of integers representing a Dijkstra map from the vector of integers representing a normal dungeon map.</description>
