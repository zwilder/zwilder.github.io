      <description>Man, I really don&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of work on this blog - maybe because I am not a web programmer but I can see when this blog does not look very good.
Well, I officially gave up on web design. Yep! Turns out, I should probably leave that to the professionals. Oh, and I also decided to heck with Jekyll. It was cool, and worked well - but searching for a premade Jekyll theme was a chore.</description>

      <description>Over the past couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on simplifying the code for my roguelike project - heavily inspired by one of my favorite books on my shelf, Game Programming Patterns.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seriously read this book cover to cover, multiple times - and every time find a new use for one of the &amp;lsquo;patterns&amp;rsquo; in it. I just discovered that the author&amp;rsquo;s blog has a bunch of good reads on it as well.</description>

      <title>Randomly Generated Caves with Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>So, every time I get the urge to write a blog post about whatever random bit of code I&amp;rsquo;m writing - I look at the blog and think: &amp;ldquo;Hm, this is kinda ugly.&amp;rdquo; Then, I have to rewrite it until I&amp;rsquo;m mostly satisfied with how it looks.
Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on writing a nice little interface for handling menus and other parts of the UI for my roguelike project. Unfortunately, like the layout of this blog, I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find a satisfactory &amp;lsquo;look and feel&amp;rsquo; - I think I&amp;rsquo;ve got a good start though.</description>

      <title>Fun With Dijkstra Mapping</title>

      <description>Continuing in my never-ending project to make a &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; roguelike in C++, I decided to tackle something I have never before tried: artificial intelligence. My first rough idea was to implement some sort of component-type system, and build the AI up like I built up entities. This turned out to be far too complicated, and even getting a monster to move randomly was a chore. Obviously, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work.</description>
