      <description>Occasionally, I get ideas that creep into my brain and won&amp;rsquo;t leave until I fully explore them. Back in February, while still enjoying the nice Arizona winters, I was hiking with my trusty old camelback. I&amp;rsquo;m fond of that pack, despite it&amp;rsquo;s many shortcomings. It has lots of fun places to attach things, and carries around 2L of water. It has zero storage capacity, although you can shove like maybe a protein bar in with the bladder&amp;hellip; but that&amp;rsquo;s it.</description>
